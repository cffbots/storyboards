## Interactive composit map

We identify from a composite of convection-permitting observational datasets, covering France, Italy, Switzerland and Germany and the years 2001 to 2009, heavy precipitation events using the MODE-MTD tracker.

The setup is given by a precipitation threshold of 5 mm/hour, a minimum volume of 100 grid cells and a smoothing in space by 3*3 grid cells.

In this interactive map one can zoom and find historic events, and look into their properties, which show up when hovering over a circle, which represents a HPE.

Properties given are: mean area, duration, distance traveled, propagation speed, total precipitation, mean and maximum precipitation rate, and several percentiles of precipitation rate. The diameter of each circle is proportional to the mean area and the color represents the intensity, by the 90th percentile of precipitation rate.
